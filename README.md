# w0rthy's Sorting Visualizer

Over 24 sorting algorithms animated with 14 unique graphic designs in 2D and 3D

A ready to use build of w0rthy's original program in C++

### Features:
- 2D and 3D visuals
- External arrays shown
- Audio of each item being processed

### Setup:
- Add libs/ to your system PATH in order to not get an error of glfw3.dll not being installed.

### Commands
- shuffle: immediately shuffles the array
- ashuffle: the shuffling is visualized
- sort: sorts the array the way it is
- ssort: shuffle + sort
- asort: ashuffle + sort
- spd (number): changes speed (default: 1)
- stop: stops the shuffle
- size (number): sets the array's size (default: 50)
- vis: changes the visualization
- wave: changes the sound
- mixwave: mixes set waves with a percentage of one and the other, and do the same with your mix
- vol (number): changes the sound volume (max recommended: 2)
- demo: runs a hardcoded sorting thread that's of w0rthy's videos
- sdemo: runs a sorting thread on the current visualization that's ordered from the slowest sorting algorithm to the fastest
- sort sort / asort sort / ssort sort: lists each sorting algorithm
- wave wave: lists the sounds
- vis vis: lists the visuals
- mixwave wave: mixes the current sound with the chosen listed one. Repeat the command to mix your current mix
